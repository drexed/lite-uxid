# Lite::Uxid

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/lite-uxid.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/lite-uxid)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drexed/lite-uxid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/drexed/lite-uxid)

Lite::Uxid is a library for generating or obfuscating ID's based on different patterns.
It's very useful to hide the number of resources in your database and protect against enumeration attacks.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lite-uxid'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lite-uxid

* [NanoID](#nanoid)
* [ULID](#ulid)
* [Options](#options)
* [ActiveRecord](#active_record)
* [Benchmarks](#benchmarks)

## Configuration

`rails g lite:uxid:install` will generate the following file in your application root:
`config/initalizers/lite_uxid.rb`

```ruby
Lite::Uxid.configure do |config|
  config.encoding_chars = '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
  config.encoding_salt = 1_369_136
  config.hashid_length = 12
  config.nanoid_length = 21
  config.ulid_length = 26
end
```

## Hashid

Hashid's are reversible and is the most performant generator.

```ruby
Lite::Uxid::Hashid.encode(10)         #=> 'q5D8inm0'
Lite::Uxid::Hashid.decode('q5D8inm0') #=> 10
```

## NanoID

NanoID are irreversible and are the second fastest ID generator but while unlikely can produce collisions.

```ruby
Lite::Uxid::Nanoid.encode #=> '0bmHjB5Gx8FTBqJekX6dS6XIXf'
```

## ULID

ULID are irreversible but provide information outside of just randomness.

```ruby
Lite::Uxid::Ulid.encode #=> '1mqfg9qa96s8s5f02o1ucf8lcc'
```

## Options

Local options can be passed to override global options.

```ruby
Lite::Uxid::Ulid.encode(chars: 'abc123', length: 12) #=> 'a3b12c12c3ca'
```

## ActiveRecord

**Table**

Add the following attribute to all corresponding tables.

```ruby
t.string :uxid, index: { unique: true }
```

**Setup**

`uxid` attribute will be automatically generated and applied when the record is created.

#### HashID
```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Lite::Uxid::Record::Hashid
end
```

#### NanoID
```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Lite::Uxid::Record::Nanoid
end
```

#### ULID
```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Lite::Uxid::Record::Ulid
end
```

**Usage**

Using one of the mixins above provides a handy method to find records by uxid.

#### HashID methods
```ruby
user = User.new
user.id_to_uxid #=> Encodes the records id to uxid
user.uxid_to_id #=> Decodes the records uxid to id
```

#### Finder methods
```ruby
User.find_by_uxid('x123')  #=> Find record by uxid
User.find_by_uxid!('x123') #=> Raises an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound error if not found
```

## Benchmarks

The classes ranked from fastest to slowest are `Hashid`, `Nanoid`, and `Ulid`.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
